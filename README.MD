# Bloons TD 6 Pseudo-Rich Presence

**This rich presence will not work by itself.**

Unfortunately, BTD6 does not have an easy way to find what map you are playing. This "Pseudo-Rich Presence" will allow you to pass arguments for your current state and have that display on your profile.

## Installation

First, clone the repository.

```cmd
git clone https://www.github.com/yolodude25/btd6-rich-presence
```

Then, install the required modules

```cmd
cd btd6-rich-presence
```

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `python-Levenshtein` causes an error, download [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).

Alternatively, you can ignore it and just run the script, but it will just show a warning when running it.

## Usage

Make a copy of [`config.ini.example`](config.ini.example) and remove the `.example`, then [edit it](#config) if you want.

Run `presence.py` with your [arguments](#arguments).

To exit the program just close the python script.

## Arguments

### `-m, --map`

Map you are playing.

#### Available Values
